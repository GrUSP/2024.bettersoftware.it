  bio: "<p>Half a designer and half an agronomy student, people would say: <em>But fully crazy!</em> Yes, thatâ€™s me.</p><p>What do I have to do with Kerning? Everything started making the conference logo: typography was an undiscovered world for me so I drowned myself in research.
Not only history and design knowledges, but over all, the stubborn pursuit of harmony and simplicity behind the work of font makers made me definitively a typelover.</p><p>In the end: the staff was so fed up of me and my suggestions to decide shutting me up by giving me some responsibility.</p>"
